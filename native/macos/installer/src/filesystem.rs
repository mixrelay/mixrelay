//! Unprivileged filesystem work for the macOS distribution transaction.
//!
//! This module deliberately stops at files and directories. It does not acquire
//! lifecycle leases, drain a running owner, call `launchctl`, reload `CoreAudio`,
//! change ownership, or verify signatures. The native privileged adapter can
//! compose these operations with the pure transaction core.
//!
//! App mutations retain the validated product-directory descriptor across renames.
//! Other destinations and private staging require protected parent directories
//! and lifecycle leases held by the privileged native adapter.
//!
//! Removal and cleanup are limited to the eight `OwnedTarget` paths, private
//! staging, and the validated empty product folder. Lifecycle lease inodes and
//! user data are never recursive removal targets here.
